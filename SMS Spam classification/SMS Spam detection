Spam messages are messages sent to a large group of recipients without their prior consent, typically advertising for goods and services or business opportunities.

In the recent period, the percentage of scam messages amongst spam have increased sharply. Scam messages typically trick people into giving away money or personal details by offering an attractive or false deal. Based on the statistics from the Singapore Police Force, from January till June 2020, the amount cheated through scams have increased by more than S$8 million!

A spam message classification is a step towards building a tool for scam message identification and early scam detection.
