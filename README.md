# Machine-Learning-Projects
Machine learning (ML) projects allow you to practice the skills youâ€™ve developed so far while giving you something to showcase in your portfolio. As a result, they not only help you better understand data science and machine learning but also can demonstrate to potential employers what you can really do when given the chance.
