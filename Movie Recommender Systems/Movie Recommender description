What are Recommender Systems ?
A recommendation system (or recommender system) is a class of machine learning that uses data to help predict, narrow down,
and find what people are looking for among an exponentially growing number of options.

A recommendation system is an artificial intelligence or AI algorithm, usually associated with machine learning,
that uses Big Data to suggest or recommend additional products to consumers. These can be based on various criteria,
including past purchases, search history, demographic information, and other factors. Recommender systems are highly 
useful as they help users discover products and services they might otherwise have not found on their own.

Type of Recommender Systems
1. Content based System
A Content-Based Recommender works by the data that we take from the user, either explicitly (rating) or 
implicitly (clicking on a link). By the data we create a user profile, which is then used to suggest to the user,
as the user provides more input or take more actions on the recommendation, the engine becomes more accurate.

2. Collabrative filter base System
Collaborative filtering algorithms recommend items (this is the filtering part) based on preference information 
from many users (this is the collaborative part). This approach uses similarity of user preference behavior, 
given previous interactions between users and items, recommender algorithms learn to predict future interaction.

3. Hybrid Recommender System
Hybrid recommender systems combine the advantages of the types above to create a more comprehensive recommending system.
